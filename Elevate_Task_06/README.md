# Expense Tracker

Develop an Expense Tracker application to efficiently manage finances.
Utilize HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
functionality. Features should include input forms for expenses,
categories, and dates, with the ability to add, edit, and delete entries.
Implement charts or graphs to visualize spending patterns. Ensure user
authentication for data security and persistence. This project will
demonstrate your skills in web development, data management, and
user experience design while providing a practical solution for personal
finance management.
